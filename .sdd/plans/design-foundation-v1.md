# Plan: Design Foundation — v1

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2026-06-28
**Last updated**: 2026-06-28
**Spec**: .sdd/specs/design-foundation-v1.md

---

## Grounding

Direct investigation re-confirmed for the plan (carried from the spec phase + re-verified):

**codegraph / Glob / Read (code structure):**
- Read `src/renderer/index.css` (the full file) — current token surface: semantic color tokens +
  radius derivations live in `@theme inline`; feature families (`--status-*`, `--event-*`×12,
  `--brand-*`, `glass-dock-*`) and three `@utility`s (`prose-cosmos`, `scrollbar-hover-only`,
  `glass-dock`) + the `cosmos-spinner-*` keyframes (the only named motion). NO typography/spacing/
  elevation/motion/z-index tokens exist. `:root` is the light fallback; `.dark` carries the real
  palette; `@layer base` + unlayered layout rules at the bottom.
- Read `src/renderer/components/ui/button.tsx` — the CVA variant/size matrix that is the template
  for the "primitive canon" documentation (variants `default|cosmos|destructive|outline|secondary|
  ghost|link`, sizes `default|xs|sm|lg|icon|icon-xs|icon-sm|icon-lg`). Note: it ships
  `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` — the OQ-2 divergence from DESIGN.md D-5's thin ring.
- Globbed `src/renderer/components/ui/*.tsx` — 16 primitives (button, badge, card, tabs, avatar,
  alert, skeleton, tooltip, select, dialog, label, switch, input, textarea, scroll-area,
  confirm-dialog).
- Grep audit of `src/renderer/**` — the drift evidence: ~85 ad-hoc arbitrary-value occurrences in
  ~26 files (typography `text-[10px]/[11px]/[13px]`, z-index `z-10/z-20/z-50` literals, motion
  `duration-[400ms]/[450ms]` + bespoke `ease-[cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)]`, elevation
  `shadow-xs/sm/lg`). GCal catalog alone ≈17.
- Read `docs/DESIGN.md` — §2 surface→token map + §5 Criteria Registry (D-1..D-5); criteria-only,
  no scale system. Confirmed it is the correct home to EXTEND.
- Globbed `.sdd/specs/*` and `.sdd/plans/*` — no dedicated `*restructure*`/`*structure*` spec/plan
  file exists in `.sdd/`; the src/ tree restructure is an in-flight orchestrator-coordinated track
  (Phase 1 excludes `src/renderer/components/`, Phase 2 handles components later). Coordination is
  captured as a cross-track dependency below, NOT as a hard blocker.

**agentmemory:**
- `memory_recall`/`memory_smart_search` for prior foundation decisions → empty; standing preference
  "Design system = Tailwind + shadcn" (real component library + designer agent) recorded in
  MEMORY.md index. Persisted this cycle's framing via `memory_save` (mem_mqx3tvq6_46ecdd7d5846).

**Adopted OQ resolutions (delegated by user as designer-territory, non-blocking):**
- **OQ-1** — define a small NAMED type ramp that INCLUDES sub-12px steps (dense panels need 10/11px);
  final names are the designer's call in the design step.
- **OQ-2** — adopt the thin ~1.5px canonical focus-ring (DESIGN.md D-5); list the Button/Badge
  `ring-[3px]` flip as a MIGRATION backlog item — do NOT flip it this cycle.
- **OQ-3** — the migration backlog lives in this plan's checklist + `TODO.md`; no new tracking doc.

---

## Summary

Establish cosmos's formal, documented **design foundation** without rewriting existing surfaces.
The heavy lifting is a **DESIGN step**: the `designer` agent authors the actual named scales for all
eight foundation areas (color reconciliation, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, motion,
z-index, primitive canon), writes them into `docs/DESIGN.md` as the authoritative foundation doc
(absorbing/extending the existing §2 surface→token map and §5 Criteria Registry **in place**), and
adds the corresponding scale tokens to `src/renderer/index.css`. The `developer` then wires any
required Tailwind v4 `@theme` config to make those tokens consumable as utility classes, verifies
the build/typecheck, and produces the **migration audit/backlog** (the ~26 files / ~85 ad-hoc
occurrences grouped by foundation area) into this checklist + `TODO.md`. The foundation is strictly
**additive**: shipped surfaces keep their exact dark appearance; drift is recorded for incremental
follow-up migration, not refactored now. cosmos stays dark-first / single-mode; no light-mode work,
no new product features, no IPC/MCP/main changes, no new UI dependency.

## Technical Context

| Item              | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Language          | CSS (Tailwind v4 `@theme`/`@utility` in `index.css`), Markdown (`docs/DESIGN.md`), no TS logic |
| Key dependencies  | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (new-york), `@tailwindcss/typography` — all already present; NONE added |
| Files to create   | (none — additive edits only) |
| Files to modify   | `src/renderer/index.css` (scale tokens), `docs/DESIGN.md` (foundation sections), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (reference the foundation), `TODO.md` (migration backlog), this plan (audit checklist) |
| Out of process    | No preload / IPC / MCP / main edits → no `npm run dev` restart concern; renderer-CSS only (HMR-friendly) |

## Implementation Checklist

> Cycle order for this UI-bearing work: **plan → DESIGN step (designer, heavy lifting) →
> interface/implement (developer wires `@theme` + produces audit) → docs/wrap-up.** Update the
> checklist as work progresses; add inline notes where a step deviates.

### Phase 0 — Pre-flight (any session)

- [ ] Read `.sdd/specs/design-foundation-v1.md`, confirm the three OQs are resolved as above (no
      open questions remain that block the design step).
- [ ] Re-read `docs/DESIGN.md` (§1–§6) and `src/renderer/index.css` so the foundation extends what
      exists rather than re-inventing it.
- [ ] Confirm the cross-track coordination note below before touching `components/ui` (see
      "Cross-track dependency").

### Phase 1 — DESIGN step (owner: `designer`; the heavy lifting) — `.sdd/designs/design-foundation-v1.md`

> The designer establishes the ACTUAL scales for all eight areas and authors them into DESIGN.md +
> index.css. Each scale must be derived FROM the values already shipped (reconcile, don't redesign)
> so the dark appearance is unchanged. No raw hex outside `index.css`.

- [ ] **(1) Color system** — formalize the existing semantic tokens (background/foreground/card/
      popover/primary/secondary/muted/accent/destructive/border/input/ring + `-foreground` pairs) as
      the core, and reconcile the implicit neutral progression (`#1e1e1e → #1b1b1c → #252526 →
      #2d2d30 → #333 → #3a3a3c → #4a4a4c`) into a documented named neutral set. Consolidate the brand/
      active-affordance rules (DESIGN.md §3) into the color section. Values UNCHANGED. (FR-001..004)
- [ ] **(2) Typography scale** — define a small NAMED type ramp (size + line-height + default weight
      per step) that COVERS the real sizes in use, INCLUDING sub-12px steps (10/11px) for dense
      panels (OQ-1). Define the allowed weight roles (normal / medium / semibold) and only the
      tracking roles actually used (uppercase micro-label `tracking-wide`). (FR-010..013)
- [ ] **(3) Spacing scale** — document the base unit + allowed steps (aligned to Tailwind's spacing
      scale) for padding/margin/gap, and the sanctioned way to express genuine off-scale density
      (calendar cells) — a documented exception or density token, not a bare arbitrary value.
      (FR-020..021)
- [ ] **(4) Radius scale** — formalize `--radius 0.5rem` → `sm/md/lg/xl` as the named radius system
      and document which surface kinds use which step. Values UNCHANGED. (FR-030)
- [ ] **(5) Elevation / shadow system** — define a named elevation ramp (flat → raised control →
      overlay/dialog → floating dock) reconciling current `shadow-xs/sm/lg` + the glass-dock's
      bespoke multi-layer shadow; classify glass-dock as the "floating dock" tier; align each level
      with its z-index layer. (FR-040..042)
- [ ] **(6) Motion tokens** — define named duration tokens (reconcile `150/200/400/450ms` → e.g.
      fast/base/slow) and named easing tokens (the existing launch curve `cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`
      + a standard ease-out); document the canonical transition recipes (overlay enter/exit, dock
      slide, composer launch); keep every motion usage `prefers-reduced-motion`-gated. (FR-050..052)
- [ ] **(7) Z-index / layering** — define a NAMED z-index ladder formalizing the current order: base
      content → panel chrome → in-panel scrim (`z-10`) → glass dock/overlay (`z-20`) → app dialog/
      popover/tooltip (`z-50`) → floating composer/drag-logo layer. Give each layer a value + a
      "what belongs here" description; record any current literal that should move as a migration
      item. (FR-060..062)
- [ ] **(8) Primitive component canon** — document the 16 `components/ui/` primitives with each
      primitive's variants/sizes + usage rule (Button matrix is the model); state the
      "compose from primitives + tokens, never invent per-surface styles" rule (consolidate
      DESIGN.md §4); record incomplete/divergent primitives (e.g. Button/Badge `ring-[3px]` vs the
      ~1.5px canon, OQ-2) as migration items — do NOT flip them here. (FR-070..072)
- [ ] **(9) Author DESIGN.md** — add the eight foundation sections to `docs/DESIGN.md`, ABSORBING/
      extending the existing §2 surface→token map and §5 Criteria Registry **in place** (no fork, no
      duplication). DESIGN.md becomes the authoritative foundation doc. (FR-080)
- [ ] **(10) Author index.css tokens** — add the new scale tokens (typography/spacing/elevation/
      motion/z-index, plus any named neutral/radius aliases) to `src/renderer/index.css` following
      existing token conventions (`@theme inline` + `:root`/`.dark`), respecting the Tailwind v4
      cascade-layer discipline (DEVELOPMENT.md). Every value matches what DESIGN.md documents.
      (FR-081)
- [ ] **(11) Design-step self-check** — verify each documented token value in DESIGN.md == the value
      in index.css (no doc/stylesheet drift); verify the foundation tokens reproduce the current dark
      appearance (no restyle).

> Note: the designer has no Bash. Any build wiring / shadcn CLI / verification is the developer's
> in Phase 2. The designer owns the scales + DESIGN.md + index.css token authoring.

### Phase 2 — Interface / wiring + audit (owner: `developer`)

- [x] **Wire Tailwind `@theme`** — made the new scale tokens consumable as utility classes.
      VERIFIED via a throwaway probe + renderer build (tailwindcss 4.3): Tailwind v4 AUTO-emits the
      `--text-*` (incl. the `--text-*--line-height` pair → `text-nano…text-title` set font-size +
      line-height), `--shadow-*` (`shadow-control/raised/overlay`), and `--ease-*`
      (`ease-standard/launch`) namespaces — NO `@utility` needed. It does NOT emit `--duration-*`,
      `--z-*`, or the custom `--space-*` namespaces, so those were exposed with explicit `@utility`
      blocks in `index.css` (`duration-micro|fast|slow|slower`, `z-raised|dock|overlay|composer`,
      `p/px/py/gap-density-1|2`, `h-cal-hour`). Token VALUES untouched. (FR-081)
- [x] **Build + typecheck green** — `npm run build` succeeds (exit 0), `npm run typecheck` clean,
      `npm test` 2566/2566 pass; no Tailwind cascade-layer regression; foundation is additive (only
      index.css token/@utility + docs/TODO changed — zero existing-surface restyle).
- [x] **Produce the migration audit/backlog** — enumerated the drifting surfaces grouped by
      foundation area (Grep of the new restructured `src/renderer/**`: 58 `text-[Npx]`/21 files,
      20 z-literals, 18 motion, 19 shadow, ~93 dense pads, the ring-[3px] sites) into the "Migration
      backlog" section below AND the "Design-foundation migration (deferred)" section of `TODO.md`.
      Includes the OQ-2 Button/Badge `ring-[3px]` → thin-ring flip (D-7) as an explicit item. (FR-082)
- [x] **Confirm no component rewrite happened** — Phase 2 added tokens/@utility + the audit list
      only; `git diff` shows index.css additions + DESIGN.md + TODO.md + this plan, no `components/ui/`
      edits, no existing-surface class changes (SC-004, out-of-scope guard).

### Phase 3 — Docs & wrap-up

- [ ] **Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — reference the formal design foundation (DESIGN.md as the
      scale-system canon) so the architecture doc stays coherent with the new system shape.
      (FR-083, SC-005) — architect-owned.
- [ ] **Reconcile `TODO.md`** — migration backlog items present under Next; mark this foundation
      cycle's establish-phase done.
- [ ] **Update this plan** — record any deviations (dated) in the Deviations section.
- [ ] **Persist learnings** — `memory_save` any non-obvious foundation decision (e.g. final ramp
      naming, ring-width canon) for future sessions.

### Verification (success criteria mapping)

- [ ] SC-001 — a sample/new surface expressible with ONLY named tokens (zero raw `text-[Npx]`,
      arbitrary spacing, `z-50` literal, bespoke `duration-[…]`/`ease-[…]`).
- [ ] SC-002 — DESIGN.md documents all eight areas; values match index.css.
- [ ] SC-003 — shipped surfaces' dark appearance unchanged by the foundation tokens.
- [ ] SC-004 — migration backlog enumerated (by area) + recorded; no mass rewrite this cycle.
- [ ] SC-005 — ARCHITECTURE.md references the foundation.
- [ ] SC-006 — feature token families (`--status-*`/`--event-*`/`--brand-*`/`glass-dock-*`)
      documented as sanctioned semantic extensions of the core.

## Cross-track dependency (coordinate, NOT blocked)

A SEPARATE in-flight sdd track is restructuring the `src/` directory tree. **Phase 1 of that
restructure EXCLUDES `src/renderer/components/`; Phase 2 moves `components/` later.** This foundation
touches `src/renderer/index.css`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, and references `src/renderer/components/ui/`.

Coordination rules (to avoid path churn — the foundation is NOT blocked by the restructure):

- **`index.css` + `docs/DESIGN.md` are safe to author now** — they are not under the restructure's
  Phase 1 moving set; do the token + DESIGN.md authoring on the current paths.
- **The primitive-canon documentation (which references `components/ui/*` paths)** should be written
  to be path-resilient: prefer naming primitives by component (e.g. "Button", "DialogContent")
  rather than hard-coding fragile relative paths, OR land the DESIGN.md primitive-canon section in a
  coordinated order with the restructure's Phase 2 `components/` move so the path references don't go
  stale immediately. If the restructure's Phase 2 lands first, write the canon against the new paths;
  if the foundation lands first, the restructure track updates the canon's path references as part of
  its Phase 2.
- **The migration audit** lists existing surfaces by FILE — note in the backlog that file paths are
  as-of authoring and may shift when the restructure's Phase 2 moves `components/`; migration work
  consuming the backlog should re-resolve paths against the then-current tree.
- **No `components/` files are edited this cycle** (foundation is additive + audit-only), so there is
  no edit-collision with the restructure — only documentation references to coordinate.

---

## Migration backlog (filled during Phase 2 — incremental follow-up, NOT this cycle)

> Grouped by foundation area. Source: the Phase-2 audit of `src/renderer/**` (~26 files / ~85 ad-hoc
> occurrences). Promote milestone items into `TODO.md`. These are follow-up migrations — the
> foundation cycle does NOT execute them.

- **Typography** — replace raw `text-[10px]/[11px]/[13px]` + ad-hoc `leading-*`/`tracking-*` with the
  named type ramp. Known hotspots: `googleCalendarCatalog/components.tsx` (~17), `PromptComposer.tsx`,
  `ConfluencePanel.tsx`, `SlackPanel.tsx`, `atlassianPanelBits.tsx`, `SurfaceSpinner.tsx`,
  `ActiveTabSurface.tsx`, the Slack/Jira/Confluence catalog rows. (to be enumerated in Phase 2)
- **Z-index** — replace literal `z-10`/`z-20`/`z-50` with named ladder layers across the four panels'
  scrim/dock overlays (`SlackPanel`/`JiraPanel`/`ConfluencePanel`/`GoogleCalendarPanel`),
  `PromptComposer` floating/drag layer, and `ui/dialog`+`ui/tooltip`. (to be enumerated)
- **Motion** — replace `duration-[400ms]/[450ms]` + bespoke `ease-[cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)]`
  (`PromptComposer`) and ad-hoc `duration-200` dock transitions with named duration/easing tokens.
- **Elevation** — replace ad-hoc `shadow-xs/sm/lg` with named elevation levels; align dock shadow to
  the documented floating-dock tier.
- **Spacing** — replace arbitrary `px-2.5`/`py-1.5`/`gap-[…]` one-offs with scale steps (or a
  documented density token for genuinely dense cells).
- **Primitive reconciliation (OQ-2)** — flip `components/ui/button.tsx` + `components/ui/badge.tsx`
  (+ `tabs.tsx`/`switch.tsx`/`select.tsx`/`scroll-area.classes.ts`/`PanelTabStrip`/`FileTabStrip`/
  `ResizeDivider`) `focus-visible:ring-[3px]` → the canonical thin (~1.5px) ring (DESIGN.md D-5/D-7),
  matching `textarea.tsx`. Deliberately NOT done this cycle.

### Phase-2 audit (enumerated 2026-06-28, restructured `src/renderer/**` tree)

Concrete counts behind the `TODO.md` "Design-foundation migration (deferred)" section:
- **Typography** — 58 `text-[Npx]` across 21 files (sizes: 15×`[10px]`, 24×`[11px]`, 2×`[12px]`,
  17×`[13px]`). Hotspot `calendar/googleCalendarCatalog/components.tsx` (15).
- **Z-index** — 20 literals (7×`z-10`, 5×`z-20`, 8×`z-50`) across 10 files incl. `ui/dialog`,
  `ui/tooltip`, `ui/select`, `ui/avatar`, `fileExplorer/ResizeDivider`.
- **Motion** — 18 raw (1×`duration-[400ms]`, 1×`duration-[450ms]`, 2×`ease-[cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)]`,
  12×`duration-200`, 1×`duration-150`) across 6 files.
- **Elevation** — 19 `shadow-xs/sm/md/lg` (5×xs, 5×sm, 3×md, 6×lg) across 14 files.
- **Spacing** — ~93 `*-1.5`/`*-2.5` dense pads (most stay on the 4px grid; selective density-token
  adoption) + a handful of off-grid arbitraries (`p-[3px]`, `my-[7px]`, `h-[64..96px]`). The calendar
  hour cell still uses a raw inline `--cal-hour-h: 2.5rem` (40px) — see the value-reconciliation caveat.
- **Ring flip (D-7)** — `ring-[3px]` on button/badge/tabs/switch/select/scroll-area + PanelTabStrip/
  FileTabStrip/ResizeDivider.

**Value-reconciliation caveat (NOT appearance-neutral):** `--space-cal-hour` is authored as **48px**
(DESIGN.md §9) but the live calendar inline `--cal-hour-h` is **40px** (`2.5rem`). Migrating the
calendar onto `--space-cal-hour`/`h-cal-hour` would change the hour-cell height; the designer must
decide (set the token to `2.5rem`, or accept the 48px bump) before that migration runs. Flagged in the
TODO row.

---

## Deviations & Notes

> Record anything that differed from plan during implementation. Date each entry.

- **2026-06-28**: Plan authored. OQ-1/2/3 adopted per the spec's recommendations (user delegated as
  designer-territory). Cross-track restructure coordination captured (no hard block; no `components/`
  edits this cycle). No `.sdd/*restructure*` spec/plan file exists yet — restructure is an in-flight
  orchestrator-coordinated track; revisit the path-coordination note when that track's Phase 2 lands.
- **2026-06-28 (Phase 2, developer)**: FR-081 wiring done. Empirically verified (probe element +
  renderer build, tailwindcss 4.3) which `@theme` namespaces auto-emit utilities. Finding that
  DIVERGED from the wiring hypothesis: `--duration-*` does **NOT** auto-map to a `duration-*` utility
  in Tailwind v4.3 (the task brief expected it to, alongside `--ease-*`); only `--text-*`, `--shadow-*`,
  and `--ease-*` auto-emit. So explicit `@utility` blocks were added for `--duration-*`, `--z-*`, and
  the custom `--space-*` (`duration-*`, `z-*`, `p/px/py/gap-density-*`, `h-cal-hour`). No token value
  changed; appearance unchanged (no existing surface references the new class names yet). Recorded the
  `--space-cal-hour` 48px-vs-live-40px value-reconciliation caveat in the audit + TODO so the calendar
  migration is not silently appearance-changing.
