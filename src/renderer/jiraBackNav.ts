/**
 * jiraBackNav — pure, framework-free back-navigation decision for the Jira panel's
 * "← Back to list" affordance (bug jira-detail-back-loses-generated-ui-v1).
 *
 * A ticket detail opened in a Jira tab is a temporary overlay over whatever list the
 * tab was showing. "Back" must return to that originating list. There are three
 * origins:
 *   - `default` — the my-tickets default board → re-run the default-view read.
 *   - `search`  — a JQL search result → re-run that search read.
 *   - `composed` — a generated-UI (`composed`) surface that was PINNED in the tab. The
 *     detail-open overwrote the tab's surface with the detail frame, so the generated
 *     UI must be RESTORED from a snapshot taken at detail-open time (no read — the
 *     surface is restored verbatim and re-marked `composed`).
 *
 * This module is intentionally React-free and DOM-free so it can be unit-tested in
 * vitest's node env (no jsdom) — the CLAUDE.md convention ("keep testable logic in a
 * plain `.ts`, never import a `.tsx` from a `.test.ts`"). `JiraPanel.tsx` holds the
 * origin in a ref and dispatches on `backNavTarget`'s result.
 */

 *   - `composed` — a pinned generated-UI surface (carries the `surface` snapshot
 *     captured at detail-open time so back can restore it without a read).
