 * PromptContext — the shared, non-secret SNAPSHOT of what the user was looking at when

 *
 * It EXTENDS the existing in-view {@link ViewContext} (the dock item already captured for
 * model grounding) with two NEW dimensions — the active panel and the active tab — so the
 * Cosmos timeline can show, alongside each historical/live user-prompt bubble, "which panel /
 * which tab / which open dock" the prompt was sent from (spec FR-001..FR-007).
 *
 * One source, two channels (spec FR-017): captured ONCE at submit, then fed to BOTH the
 * authoritative `viewContextGroundingClause` (`--append-system-prompt`) AND the additive
 * `<cosmos:context>` marker — both derived from this single object so they can never disagree.
 *
 * PURE shared data: NO renderer, React, fs, or Electron import — importable by main, preload,
 * and renderer and unit-testable in node. Every field is a NON-SECRET display/identity label
 * (spec FR-008): NEVER a token, OAuth secret, credential, file path, `~/.claude` location, or
 * raw transcript line. The dock REUSES the literal {@link ViewContext} item fields (FR-005) — it
 * introduces NO parallel item shape and NO new field.
